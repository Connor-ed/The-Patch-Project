The Patch Project originally started as The Crave Patch Project in early 2025. I had purchased a Behringer Crave and realized I couldnâ€™t find any patch sheets that were easy to follow and use. I decided to start building this app to hold and preview patches I had made in the past, and chose to open source it so others could use it. I slowly realized that I wanted to support other synths I owned, so I changed the name and began laying the groundwork for a system of simple and intuitive visual patching.
